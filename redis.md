Redis is a key-value store, which means it stores data as pairs of keys and values. 
The values can be a variety of data structures, such as strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, and hyperloglogs
Redis is a server-based solution that runs as a separate process, t
typically on a remote server, but can also be hosted on a local machine or in a containerized environment. 
Both Java and Python have libraries that allow easy interaction with Redis.
