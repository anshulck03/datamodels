SQLite - https://sqlite.org/index.html
Open Source
Uses a relational data model which organizes data in tables consisting of rows and columns
SQLite is an embedded database, which means it is directly integrated into the application that uses it. 
Unlike other databases, SQLite does not run as a separate server process. 
Instead, the SQLite library is linked with the application, and the database is stored as a single file on disk
Both Java and Python have libraries that allow easy interaction with SQLite databases.
