Robomongo or Robo 3T - https://robomongo.org

Open Source
As Robo 3T is a GUI for MongoDB, it uses the same data model as MongoDB. 
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in BSON format (Binary JSON), 
which is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. 
It supports a flexible schema, allowing documents in a collection to have different fields and structures.

Robo 3T is a desktop application that runs on your local machine. 
It connects to local or remote MongoDB instances and helps you manage databases, collections, documents, and perform various database operations. 
It does not host the MongoDB instance itself.

Since Robo 3T is a GUI tool, Java and Python do not access it directly. 
However, you can use Java and Python to interact with MongoDB, the database that Robo 3T manages.


*** HOW IT IS DIFFERENT ***

Robomongo is not a database itself but a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing MongoDB databases. 
Therefore, it does not have its own database model but uses the data model of MongoDB.

MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored in BSON format (Binary JSON). 
It allows for flexible schema, meaning documents in a collection can have varying fields and structures. 
Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle use a relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. 
In relational databases, schema is predefined, and all rows in a table must conform to this schema.
