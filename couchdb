CouchDB - https://couchdb.apache.org
Open Source
CouchDB uses a document-oriented data model, where data is stored as JSON documents.
CouchDB is a server-based solution that runs as a separate process, typically on a remote server, 
but it can also be hosted on a local machine or in a containerized environment
Both Java and Python have libraries that allow easy interaction with CouchDB databases.
